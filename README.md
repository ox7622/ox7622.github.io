## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html
First of all open index.html in your browser 
To make optimization happen I reviewed the timeline and noticed there was 2 links to stylesheets.
When I fixed that the whole page started rendering much quicker.
Then I pasted the stylesheet directly into the webpage at the end of the code.
To avoid block rendering I put Js for Google analytics separately and added async tag. I also added another stylesheet with media query of max-width of 480px.
To optimize Google font I used @font-face to select the particular version of the font for browser to use.

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

The main thing that influenced bad performance of the pizza page was that every time I scrolled the page should have repainted and changed it's layout. 
I changed the quantity of pizzas to 50 as it's a maximum amount of them the viewer can see. To make optimize animation I amended updatePoistions function by get the scrollTop event outside the loop to make it render once, not for every pizza.
Also I changed querySelector to getElementById/getElementsByClassName as more efficient option to grab selectors.
Another optmization was to initialize variable outside the loops - for elem and phase variables, and also call the length property outside of loops.

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
